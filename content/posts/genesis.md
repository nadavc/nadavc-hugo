This is my third attempt at a blog. Why start another one? I have plenty of reasons **not** to. It's time consuming, difficult, irrelevant, boring, repetitive…  But I also have good reasons. I want to improve at articulating my ideas and keep a journal of my learnings (professionally or otherwise). I will try my best to post original content and stay out of clichés, but I can't promise anything :-)
